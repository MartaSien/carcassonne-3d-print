# Carcassonne 3D Print

### Welcome! 🏰

This is a repository with 3D models of tiles from the board game "Carcassonne", prepared for 3D printing, in .stl. All models were custom made based on the original drawings.

The models will include the base game. Hopefully, in the future, I'll be able to prepare tiles from the expansions!


### Tile list 🎨

Below you can find a top view for each uploaded tile, alongside its name (according to "Carcassonne" board game manual). Tiles are still a work in progress - I will be updating the repository with new designs.

[A](A.stl) | [B](B.stl) | [D](D.stl) | [U](U.stl) | [W](W.stl) | [X](X.stl)
